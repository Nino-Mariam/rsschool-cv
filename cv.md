# Hello
 My name is Nino-Mariam Taralashvili.
*You can contact me via phone, my number is (+995) 593 357 058, also I am avalaible on Facebook(Nino-Mariam Taralashvili) and on the Discord(nini#005).*


 **My main goal for now is to be succesfull web developer, also in the future I view myself as confident, strong and well educated woman in the technology field, who is helping young people in finding their career path and to motivate them. I wish that some day I will tell others that they should never ever give up and that they should see challenges or obstacles as opportunities, not as problems. I want that to happen because, I wish someone gave me that encouragement when I was younger. When it comes to me I am perfectionist and I want everything to be as perfect as it can be, coding is not exception. I am very open-minded and outgoing. I love new challenges, because I personally, always learn something exciting from it. I have no working experience as a Junior Developer, but I am willing to learn, to become a professional and this is exactly why I chose your course.**

**What about my coding skills? Well, I was 18 years old when programming got interesting for me, so I started studying it online: I learnt c#, javascript, HTML and CSS on my own and I studied c++ and Java at Tbilisi State University, I also was interested in ASP.NET MVC. Currently I am learning react.**

I finished 25th public school in Rustavi, currently I am a student and I am studying at Tbilisi State University, as I mentioned it. I have learnt most of the programming languages on my own via Youtube, freecodecamp, w3schools and platforms like that. I also was in a bittcamp for a while and my team leader was Oto Zakalashvili.


My relationship with English started when I was 15 years old, well of course I was studying this beautiful language at school, but in my teenage years I decided to learn it on my own, because English that my school tought me was not enough, so I started watching video tutorials, also I was reading English literature and so on. In the age of 18 I started going to an advanced English course. I was studying English there(for 1 year) from books like: Laser B2 and Destination.
