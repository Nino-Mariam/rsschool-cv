 **My main goal for now is to be succesfull web developer, also in the future I view myself as confident, strong and well educated woman in the technology field, who is helping young people in finding their career path and to motivate them. I wish that some day I will tell others that they should never ever give up and that they should see challenges or obstacles as opportunities, not as problems. I want that to happen because, I wish someone gave me that encouragement when I was younger. When it comes to me I am perfectionist and I want everything to be as perfect as it can be, coding is not exception. I am very open-minded and outgoing. I love new challenges, because I personally, always learn something exciting from it. I have no working experience as a Junior Developer, but I am willing to learn, to become a professional and this is exactly why I chose your course.**

**What about my coding skills? Well, I was 18 years old when programming got interesting for me, so I started studying it online: I learnt c#, javascript, HTML and CSS on my own and I studied c++ and Java at Tbilisi State University, I also was interested in ASP.NET MVC. Currently I am learning react.**
